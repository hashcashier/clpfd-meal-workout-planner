Meal Scheduler
The meals every person eats affect whether they gain/lose weight. Thus the user should first specify through the GUI:
a) Whether they would like to build or lose weight.

b) How many meals they would have every day (3-5).


The meals the users get should ensure the following: (please note that we assume a 5-meals plan)
a) The total amount of calorie and food type intake abide by the medical calculations provided through the excel sheet.
Note that 1 gram of carbs = 4 calories, 1 gram of protein = 4 calories, 1 gram of fat = 9 calories.

b) The third meal can be repeated with a maximum of two times every week. (?)
(The set of all third meals in a week does not contain more than 2 duplicates)

c) The weekly meal plan should never be repeated as it is within the same month.

d) There are items that are preferable/not preferable to be eaten in some specific meals. For example,
it is not preferable to have chicken for breakfast. Your meal plan should have as little of such meals
as possible.

e) There are some popular meal combinations. Your plan should try to include such preferable meals
as much as possible (as long as they fit the requirement calories/constituents).

F = 0.4 * LBM per pound
P = (1.5 or 1.6) * LBM per pound
C = (Calories - (9F + 4P))/4

BMR = 370 + 21.6 * LBM (kg)

Tolerance -> Cut(-100cal carbs), Bulk(+- 100 cal carbs)
Fats +- 5g
Protein +- 30g

The workout starts off by 5 sets then 4 sets then 3 sets then 3 sets and then 3 sets.

The number of times every exercise is repeated has a fixed scheme of either 20/20/20/20/20 or 15/12/10/8/6 or 12/10/8/6/4 or 12/12/10/8/8 or 5/5/5/5/5.

For example if the 15/12/10/8/6 strategy was used, then the first exercise in the first set is repeated 15 times and the second exercise is repeated for 12 times, ... etc.

After finishing the 5 exercise set, the exercises of the next 4-set are repeated 12/10/8/6 times correspondingly.

The same is applied for the rest of the sets and strategies

15/12/10/8/6
15/12/10/8
15/12/10
15/12/10
15/12/10

cut -> cardio
bulk -> no cardio

exactly 2 5 star per muscle group

hamstrings & quads together

legs & back mutex
legs & chest mutex

The user should enter the number of times he/she visits a gym.

This is a number between 3 and 5.

The system should produce a schedule for the exercises to be done to train all muscles.

The schedule should span over a month.

It should make sure that different repetition strategies are used within the month.

Through the GUI, users should be able to access the exercise schedule.

For each exercise the user can click on a youtube video showing how it should be done.
